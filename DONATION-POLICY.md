---

## 🏢 Receiving Entity

All donations are received by:

Am Neumarkt 22  
45663 Recklinghausen  
EU / Germany

Donations are treated as **business income** under German tax law and taxed accordingly.

## 💳 Accepted Payment Methods

### Fiat Currency (EUR)

| Platform | Link | Fees |
|----------|------|------|
| **Ko-fi** | [ko-fi.com/cannatoshi](https://ko-fi.com/cannatoshi) | 0% (PayPal fees apply) |
| **GitHub Sponsors** | *Coming soon* | 0% |

### Cryptocurrency

| Currency | Accepted | Wallet Address |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Bitcoin (BTC)** | ✅ Yes | `[ADDRESS COMING SOON]` |
| **Ethereum (ETH)** | ✅ Yes | `[ADDRESS COMING SOON]` |
| **Monero (XMR)** | ❌ **No** | Not accepted (see below) |
| **Other Privacy Coins** | ❌ **No** | Not accepted |

#### ⚠️ Why No Monero/Privacy Coins?

Due to EU Anti-Money Laundering Regulation 2024/1624, privacy coins like Monero will be prohibited from regulated exchanges starting 2027. Major exchanges (Binance, Kraken, OKX) have already delisted XMR. This makes it impossible to:

1. Convert donations to EUR through legal channels
2. Document the origin of funds for tax purposes
3. Comply with German documentation requirements

We support privacy technology, but must operate within legal boundaries.
